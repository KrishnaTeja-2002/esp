Sprint 1 Progress: Hayden Karl

The issue I'm working on currently requires me to design some prototypes of the view of the user for this 
application. Our group met with Dr. McCulla, a professor in the Chemistry department to get his feel for the look
and some desired functionality of these prototypes. Saved in this dir is a screenshot of the current view of the 
ORCA file converter.


Dr. McCulla didn't suggest any styling for the page, however he did inform me that the current elements already on
the view, such as the file selector button, the section selection dropdown tab, and the file name text box are all
features he wants to stay the same, with maybe slight optimizations for the backend as needed. He also wanted the 
ability to enter in keywords that the application would search for and use the data that is under the keywords, so 
another textbox that takes keywords will be necessary. This, however, is all he suggested, so I'll design a couple
of simple pages with these suggestions in mind while also adding some stylings of my own. My stylings won't detract
from the functionality or use of the page. My goal is to make this page look more like something a company or school
would deploy for public use rather than a barebones page. 

The directory for the prototypes is made as stated in the root directory.
